\chapter*{Abstract}

The protein folding problem is the search for a 
function that maps a proteins primary structure, 
composed of a string of discrete amino acid residues to 
their respective native conformation in 
3D space denoted as the protein's tertiary structure. 
Recent breakthroughs in the field have utilize 
techniques such as multiple sequence alignment 
coupled with residual convolutional neural networks 
to derive candidate posteriors over the distribution 
of inter-residue distances from which multiple 
energetically favourable tertiary structures can be 
generated; these results are typically annealed to produce 
a structure of lowest conformational energy. In this work 
I propose an alternative deep reinforcement learning 
system that does not rely on the pre-existing data of 
other sequences and instead approximates the pair-wise 
local interactions of the residues on a 
3D Face-Centered Cubic Lattice model. 
I show that mean-field approximations 
effectively model the the free energy landscape 
of the system with respect to the expectation of 
the distribution of rewards in the local neighbourhood 
for each agent. I propose that the architecture of 
this system effectively incorporates inductive bias 
into the problem formulation and thus provides a 
richer training signal. Additional techniques are 
also employed in combination to 
reduce the sample complexity of the search space.
